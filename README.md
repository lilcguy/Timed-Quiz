# Timed Quiz

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
The motivation behind making a timed quiz was to apply concepts learned in class in JavaScript to make a webpage dynamic and responsive to user input.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This project served as review and application of concepts learned in class.
- What problem does it solve?
This is a demonstration of a practical application of JavaScript. Quizzes are one of the most common ways of assessing knowledge in any educational institution.
- What did you learn?
I brute forced my way through the project by making different functions for almost every piece of functionality. I learned that I could host a function within a function, and can then call that parent function to run its contents. That was used specifically with
the timer on the page. My code was long and meandering, and certainly at points I am unable to detect at my skill level redundant, but is marginally functional.
